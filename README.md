# Police FOI unit dubbed 'authoritarian censor'



In March 2025, we reported how a national policing unit had been criticised for telling local forces to block the release of information under laws designed to safeguard the public's right to know.

The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) had advised forces not to reveal information on topics including the use of banned surveillance software and the spread of super-strength drugs, we had found.

Campaign group Big Brother Watch said the NPCC team – known as the central referral unit (CRU) – had been acting like an "authoritarian censor" rather than a public body.

The CRU said it acted in line with legislation and only recommended how local forces should respond to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.
