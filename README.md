# Police FOI unit dubbed 'authoritarian censor'



In March 2025, we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn0ypn4pyyro) how a national policing unit had been criticised for telling local forces to block the release of information under laws designed to safeguard the public's right to know.

The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) had advised forces not to reveal information on topics including the use of banned surveillance software and the spread of super-strength drugs, we had found.

Campaign group Big Brother Watch said the NPCC team – known as the central referral unit (CRU) – had been acting like an "authoritarian censor" rather than a public body.

The CRU said it acted in line with legislation and only recommended how local forces should respond to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.

# The UK data we provided:

- The number of Freedom of Information (FOI) and Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) requests referred by each police force to the CRU in each month from January-March 2024 (the CRU could only provide 3 months’ of data within cost limits in responding to the BBC Shared Data Unit’s FOI request)
- Of the above referrals, the number of FOI/EIR requests referred which were about the NPCC CRU’s so-called "mandatory" topics which were explained and included in our story pack - NB: these were only partial figures 
- The total number of FOI and EIR requests received by each police force in each month from January-March 2024, according to the NPCC’s performance monitoring statistics
- The equivalent number of FOI/EIR requests which received CRU advice - eg from January to March 2024 Avon and Somerset Police received 468 FOI requests. It referred 34 to the CRU, equivalent to 1 in 11 it received.
- Examples of regulatory action over poor FOI performance relating to police forces since 2020 from the website of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) for context.
