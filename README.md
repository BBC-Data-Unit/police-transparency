# Police FOI unit dubbed 'authoritarian censor'



In March 2025, we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn0ypn4pyyro) how a national policing unit had been criticised for telling local forces to block the release of information under laws designed to safeguard the public's right to know.

The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) had advised forces not to reveal information on topics including the use of banned surveillance software and the spread of super-strength drugs, we had found.

Campaign group Big Brother Watch said the NPCC team – known as the central referral unit (CRU) – had been acting like an "authoritarian censor" rather than a public body.

The CRU said it acted in line with legislation and only recommended how local forces should respond to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.

# Background

We were alerted to the unit's involvement in local forces' FOI responses while researching [the spread of potent synthetic opioids](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2520kvl1wo).

Sixteen police forces - more than a third of the forces covering the UK - had given details to us about crimes linked with the drugs, but then retracted their responses at the CRU's request.

The CRU argued the information would undermine national security as it could be exploited by drug traffickers.

Our subsequent investigation found the CRU had advised local police forces on 1,706 FOI requests in the first three months of 2024 - equivalent to one in every 11 requests they received in that time.

On another occasion, it advised forces to retract earlier responses and instead neither confirm or deny if their officers had used the facial recognition search engine PimEyes, [citing concerns about "negative press"](https://libertyinvestigates.org.uk/articles/met-police-computers-access-dangerous-facial-recognition-search-engine/).

The software had been [banned by Scotland Yard](https://inews.co.uk/news/met-police-accessed-facial-recognition-site-3041656?srsltid=AfmBOop5dIXkGlOfT0fmrLE7NwuAX4AsnSafgqikWrSWhtGRYyC0fWJc).

# Our findings in brief

Our investigation showed the CRU had:
- advised local police forces on 1,706 FOI requests in the first three months of 2024 - equivalent to one in every 11 requests they had received in that time
- advised forces to rescind earlier responses and instead neither confirm or deny if their officers had used the face recognition search engine PimEyes, which had been banned by Scotland Yard, citing concerns about "negative press", according to documents obtained by Liberty Investigates
- recorded the organisation of the requester in its database and had internal discussions mentioning when FOI responses would "likely attract media attention", contrary to the applicant-blind principle of FOI
- said it could not share records of when it had conducted public interest tests and if and when it favoured disclosure of information, according to the spirit of FOI laws
- had "mandatory referral" topics on which it wanted local police forces to ask for advice but had only limited records of when it had advised on these 
- Correspondence revealed under FOI showed the NPCC press office had been asking about “Alex from BBC” with the CRU in relation to the Shared Data Unit’s FOI research into the spread of synthetic opioids before we had begun any conversation with the NPCC on the topic
- Documents also showed that the CRU had advised police forces on FOI responses/internal review requests/ICO complaints from George Greenwood, ex-BBC and now investigations reporter at The Times, including relating to copies of Metropolitan Police press office correspondence concerning the policing of the vigil at Clapham Common related to the death of Sarah Everard, and the use of tasers by officers on children

# What we provided:

- The number of Freedom of Information (FOI) and Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) requests referred by each police force to the CRU in each month from January-March 2024 (the CRU could only provide 3 months’ of data within cost limits in responding to the BBC Shared Data Unit’s FOI request)
- Of the above referrals, the number of FOI/EIR requests referred which were about the NPCC CRU’s so-called "mandatory" topics which were explained and included in our story pack - NB: these were only partial figures 
- The total number of FOI and EIR requests received by each police force in each month from January-March 2024, according to the NPCC’s performance monitoring statistics
- The equivalent number of FOI/EIR requests which received CRU advice - eg from January to March 2024 Avon and Somerset Police received 468 FOI requests. It referred 34 to the CRU, equivalent to 1 in 11 it received.
- Examples of regulatory action over poor FOI performance relating to police forces since 2020 from the website of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) for context.
